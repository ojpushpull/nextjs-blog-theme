Hello and Happy Sunday or whatever day you happen to be reading this post on. I wasnt sure on what I wanted to do with this site 
but decided that Id keep it and just change its purpose from a strict developer blog to more of a tech solopreneur with a sprinkle of 
lifestyle blog. I feel like that change will give me an opening on more topics to write about and make it appealing to a wider audience.
I want this blog to give my brand identitiy so yea thats one plan.

The next plan is launching some online business. I am still committed to creating digital products and services that are focused around
substance abuse, and recovery. I have alot of ideas I've come up with some big some small so Ive spent alot of time mentally planning
and it brought me to two conclusions. 

1) Coding a big project from scratch is hard. Maybe theres some super developers out there who could code entire huge products from out 
of thin air but thats not me. 

2) There is alot more that goes into a digital business besides just making it and putitng it online. Theres marketing, testing
server costs, updates, security and the list goes on.

These 2 main things made me really think about how I want to go about launching my online recovery stuff so I decided that Id keep my
initial projects as simple as possible. Simple meaning the product doesnt need alot of explanation, it doesnt require a huge technical foundation
and its something that can be launched and ran quickly and easily. These decisions helped me come up with my first project, a website 
selling recovery based apparel. I want to launch some other stritcly digital product around the same time as it so I am still deciding 
on that but it will follow the guidelines I just mentioned. 

I really want ot make this happen and I realize that sometimes I need to travel the road of least resistance cause things are going to happen
so at least if I do something that by itself has less roadblocks Ill deal with less problems ( I hope anyways ).

Enjoy your day,
Okera
